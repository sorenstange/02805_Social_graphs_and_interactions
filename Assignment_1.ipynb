    "Answer: In random networks the different nodes does not have a very large difference in the number of links to other nodes. This is in contrast to real world phenomena, where (in the social network for instance) we have some outliers who know many thousands of people, and some who do not know almost any. We are missing the big Hubs which connect a lot of people. This can be seen in chapter 3.5 Image 3.6, where the actual degree distribution of a real network, does not at all reflect the idealized version of the random network."

    "Answer: The four regimes that characterize random networks are: \n",
    "1) Subcritical Regime | Here the average degree of a node <k> < 1. This results in a network consisting of many tiny clusters. That is, a highly disconnected network of nodes. The largest cluster in this domain is roughly of size ln N\n",
    "2) Critical point | Here we have <k> = 1. This lead s to a significant jump in the size of the largest cluster in the network. We still don't have a giant component, however the largest cluster is rougly of size N^(2/3).\n",
    "3) Supercritical Regime | Here we have <k> > 1. In this regime we start to have giant component. The size of the largest component is roughly (p-1/N)N. In this regime we will have multiple connected components coexisting with the giant component.\n",
    "4) Connected Regime | Here we have <k> > ln N. In this regime the giant component absorbs all other nodes, leaving (almost) no isolated nodes."

    "Answer: Beacause in the random network we expect the culstering coefficient to decrease as N grows. This is in contrast to real networks where this decreases as a function of k. This means that the clustering coefficient in real networks are more or less independent of the size of the network size."
